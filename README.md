This is just a little practice project for learning how to do trash management in C with GLib. Much of this will likely go directly in the C port of my [Budgie Trash Applet](https://github.com/EbonJaeger/budgie-trash-applet).

## Dependencies

- glib
- gio
- ninja (to build the project)

## Building

Build as you would any Meson/Ninja project. Configure with `meson build`, and build with `ninja -C build`.
